Payments Calculator Application
Overview
This C# Windows Forms application is designed to calculate the cost of services based on time spent on different tasks. It was one of my initial projects in C#, providing a simple yet effective demonstration of basic programming concepts in Windows Forms. The application calculates the cost for three types of tasks: Firm, Rep, and Emb.

Features
User Input for Task Times: Users can input the time spent on each of the three tasks in separate text boxes.
Cost Calculation: The application calculates the total cost based on predefined rates for each task.
Additional Charges Option: An option to add extra charges is available through a checkbox.
Error Handling: Basic error handling for non-numeric inputs and empty fields.

Visual Studio or any compatible IDE that supports C# and Windows Forms development.
